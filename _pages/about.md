<!-- BIO SECTION -->
I am a Computer Science undergraduate at **Information Technology University (ITU)**. My research interests lie at the intersection of **Software Engineering** and **Artificial Intelligence**, with a specific focus on **Automated Test Repair** and mitigating **LLM Bias**.

Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant at **Tufts University** and the **UIUC+ Research Program**, where I investigated fairness in large language models and software reliability. I am passionate about building secure, reliable, and human-centered intelligent systems.

### 🔬 Research Experience

**Bias in LLMs & Neurodiversity**
*Tufts University | Advisor: Rukhshan Haroon*
<br>
Investigated bias in Large Language Models when interpreting autistic vs. neurotypical communication.
*   Curated a dataset of **two-turn dialogues** and conducted **1,200+ controlled GPT-4o evaluations**.
*   Performed statistical analysis (Stuart–Maxwell, Holm–Bonferroni) to quantify distribution shifts in model judgments.
*   *Keywords: LLMs, Fairness, Thematic Analysis, Statistics*

**Automated Test Repair & Software Reliability**
*UIUC+ Research Program | Advisor: Prof. Darko Marinov*
<br>
Conducted an in-depth literature review and implemented automated testing pipelines.
*   Analyzed **repair reliability**, **flaky tests**, and **obsolete test detection**.
*   Utilized symbolic and concolic execution techniques to improve test coverage.
*   *Keywords: Software Testing, Automated Repair, Python, CI/CD*

**HCI & Mental Health AI**
*AIT / Punjab University | Advisor: Dr. Faisal Bukhari*
<br>
Conducted a mixed-methods study (n=50) on mental health chatbots.
*   Analyzed interaction data using **Wilcoxon signed-rank** and **Kruskal–Wallis H** tests.
*   Evaluated emotional support and perceived helpfulness of chatbots.
