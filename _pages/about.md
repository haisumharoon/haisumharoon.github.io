<!-- BIO SECTION -->
I am a Computer Science undergraduate at **Information Technology University (ITU)**. My research interests lie at the intersection of **Software Engineering** and **Artificial Intelligence**, with a focus on building **reliable, secure, and fair** intelligent systems.

Currently, I am a Research Assistant at the **UIUC+ Research Program**, working on automated test repair under **Prof. Darko Marinov**. I am also investigating **LLM bias** regarding neurodiversity at **Tufts University**.

I have a strong commitment to continuous learning, having completed **32+ certifications** across Data Science, AR/VR, and IoT. I aim to bridge the gap between rigorous software testing and human-centered AI.
