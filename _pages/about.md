<!-- BIO SECTION -->
I am a Computer Science undergraduate at **Information Technology University (ITU)**. My research interests include **Software Engineering** and **Large Language Models**, with a specific focus on **Automated Test Repair** and mitigating **LLM Bias**.

Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant at **Tufts University** and the **UIUC+ Research Program**, where I investigated fairness in large language models and software reliability. I am passionate about building secure, reliable, and human-centered intelligent systems.

<!-- RESEARCH EXPERIENCE SECTION -->
### 🔬 Research Experience

**Bias in LLMs & Neurodiversity**
*Tufts University | Rukhshan Haroon*
<br>
Investigated bias in LLMs when interpreting autistic vs. neurotypical communication.
*   Curated a dataset of **two-turn dialogues** in collaboration with an **autistic advisory board**.
*   Conducted **1,200+ controlled GPT-4o evaluations** to measure disclosure effects.
*   Performed statistical analysis (**Stuart–Maxwell**, **Holm–Bonferroni**) to quantify distribution shifts.
*   Conducted **thematic analysis** (Braun & Clarke) on model explanations using **NVivo** to identify reasoning patterns.
*   *Keywords: LLMs, Fairness, Thematic Analysis, Statistics*

**Automated Test Repair & Software Reliability**
*UIUC+ Research Program | Darko Marinov*
<br>
Conducted an in-depth literature review on automated test repair (papers from **FSE, ISSTA, USENIX**).
*   Implemented automated testing pipelines to analyze **repair reliability**, **mutation behavior**, **obsolete test detection**, and **flaky tests**.
*   Studied **symbolic and concolic execution** techniques to improve coverage.
*   Wrote **reproducibility scripts in Python** to validate results across multiple testing frameworks.
*   *Keywords: Software Testing, Automated Repair, Python, CI/CD*

**HCI & Mental Health AI**
*AIT / Punjab University | Faisal Bukhari*
<br>
Conducted a mixed-methods study (n=50) on mental health chatbots.
*   Analyzed interaction data using **Wilcoxon signed-rank** and **Kruskal–Wallis H** tests.
*   Evaluated emotional support and perceived helpfulness of chatbots.
